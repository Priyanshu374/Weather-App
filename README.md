# Weather-App
This is a simple Weather Application written in C++ that fetches and displays weather information for a given city using the OpenWeatherMap API. The application is modular and well-structured, making it easy to maintain and extend. It uses the libcurl library to make HTTP requests and the jsoncpp library to parse JSON responses.
